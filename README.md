### Prediction App
This app is trained on the ordered and disordered spin configurations of a spin model described by the hamiltonian,
$$H = -J_{1}\sum_{\langle ij\rangle} S_{i}S_{j} - J_{2}\sum_{\langle \langle ij \rangle \rangle}S_{i}S_{i}$$
I have used a Convolutional Neural Network to peform task of the classification. The network is trained to differentiate between
ferromagnet, anti-ferromagnet, stripe ordered and disordered phase.
